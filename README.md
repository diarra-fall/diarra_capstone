## Motivation
As a resident of a city that does not have many public transportation options, I tend to make assumptions about the accessibility to public transit that residents in larger cities have and how that affects their habits. When I visited Chicago last year, it seemed like there was public transportation everywhere I looked. Iâ€™m curious about whether Chicagoans use private modes of transportation when public transportation is available.

## Data Questions
	- Which areas are people using private transportation to get to and from most frequently? 
	- Are those routes served by public transportation?
